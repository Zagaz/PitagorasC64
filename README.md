# PitagorasC64
A program in BASIC for Commodore-64 to calculate the Hypotenuse.
On the COVID-19 quarentine, I use my time to learn BASIC using the Commodore 64.

Back in the 80's, here in Brazil, my family couldn't afford a Commodore 64 (Or similar). So, years passed... Things changed... And the year was 2018. 

I was just googling something related to programming and a blog post just appeared. The post is called: "Learning BASIC Like It's 1983". This post had a very strong effect on me. Weeks lates, started the COVID-19 lockdown here in Rio de Janeiro, so I was at home, and with lot of time, so I decided to follow the same steps on the post.

First, I downloaded the Commodore User's Guide in PDF (). Then, I downloaded the VICE (A C64 Emulator). The rest is history, I read the whole book and did all the exercises. After all that, I decided to put my knowledge in practice and I made this program, just for fun!!!
